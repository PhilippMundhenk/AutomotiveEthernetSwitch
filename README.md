# AutomotiveEthernetSwitch
This is a prototype implementation of an FPGA-based switch for Automotive Ethernet Applications. It is optimized for the Xilinx Zynq-7000 All Programmable SoC ZC706 Evaluation Kit with Tokyo Electron Device TB-FMCL-GLAN 1000 Base-T Ethernet FMC adapters.

To build the bitstream, a license for the Xilinx Tri-Mode Ethernet Media Access Controller (TEMAC) in version 8.3 is required.

The design and implementation of this work has been performed by *Andreas Ettner*.
